    <div class="py-2 text-justify text-lg">
      I am a Machine Learning Engineer and Ph.D. candidate in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Tehran,
      specializing in Agentic AI, LLMs, and multimodal learning. Currently, I work as a Machine Learning Researcher
      at the Pacific Parkinson Research Centre at UBC Hospital, where I design and productionize end-to-end ML pipelines
      integrating video, audio, and clinical data for neurological assessment. My research focuses on leveraging weak
      supervision, temporal modeling, and explainable AI to bridge the gap between research prototypes and deployment-ready
      systems. I am passionate about building scalable ML systems that make a real-world impact in healthcare and cognitive science.
